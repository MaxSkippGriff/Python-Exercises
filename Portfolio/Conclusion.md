# Conclusion

In this final section, we reflect on our application and how far we've come. We start by reflecting on our working practices, evaluating strengths and weaknesses. We the go on to reflect on the success of the project, with a focus on whether the brief and objectives were met. We then assess the impact Covid-19 had on our project. Finally, we discuss the social and ethical implications of our product and look ahead to future work in terms of design, development and evaluation, and the impact of our work more generally.

## Reflection on working practices

We now turn to our working practices. In particular, we discuss our main lines of communication, application of the Agile methodology, and management of sprints, as well as assess how we used GitHub and worked as a team.


### Our working practices

Throughout the project the team was well organised and attended meetings often. This allowed for good discussion on weekly progress and helped keep the team motivated with a clear direction. Furthermore, this allowed us to allocate people to specific tasks and avoid any crossovers. We also thoroughly documented our [discussions](../Portfolio/Team_Meetings.md) so that everyone could see the expectations and tasks.

With the use of Microsoft Teams and Discord we were able to communicate effectively between each other. Our use of the group chat was effective for not only troubleshooting but highlighting progress. This helped the team easily see the lifecycle of the project and kept us all motivated. The Agile approach suited our project really well and helped everyone manage their workload effectively alongside other university work. With clear and defined tasks allocated to each of us we were able to easily follow the model. Our sprints were effective and well documented and clearly showed the progress made as our app came to life.

### Microsoft Teams & Discord

Throughout the project we had strong communication between team members through the use of Microsoft Teams. Initially we tried also using the Discord platform and it was useful to share ideas however Microsoft Teams became the main area of team communication. Microsoft Teams was an excellent platform and we used the group chat effectively for troubleshooting, highlighting progress and further organisation. The individual chats were helpful for team members working closely together on the app or communicating changes being done on the Git repo. We also had all our meetings on Teams with most of them running smoothly. We would always encourage the use of the camera’s which rarely caused any trouble on the platform. The share feature was also very smooth and allowed team members to show off their progress with ease. For the most part Teams was very suitable to our project. However, there were occasional issues with the connection to Teams for different members. Also, it noticeably reduced the performance of your laptop which did make it tough for Team members to use while they have a lot of processes running.

Overall, Microsoft Teams was a very good platform for our collaboration throughout the project given the COVID circumstances. This alongside the effectiveness of our Team members made communication seamless. It may be worth exploring other platforms but for the most part Teams is good choice when it comes to group work.

### Agile and Jira

The Agile approach suited our project really well and helped everyone manage their workload effectively alongside other university work. With clear and defined tasks allocated to each of us we were able to easily approach weekly sprints. Furthermore, we could analyse what was completed and how it would affect our stakeholders before we moved onto future sprints. Our use of proto-personas to create user stories, as detailed in the section on [UX Design](../Portfolio/UX_Design.md), proved very helpful during our sprints, since they forced us to implement user stories. This motivated us to prioritise tasks and implement key features each week, and use the proto-personas as a way to reflect on the design and functionality of those features which would shed light on any design issues. This meant that we could apportion enough time for each feature, so that we weren't focusing on any particular part of the product.

We also utilized the Jira software effectively for our sprints. We started by laying out the tasks needed in the ‘To Do’ section. This was a rough draft and some tasks were broken up into multiples later. We then allocated team members in our meetings and moved to the ‘In Progress’ section once they had started. Finally, we could tick of and move tasks to the ‘Done’ pane once team members had progressed. Whilst Jira was helpful, some issues were noted in the way that tasks could still remain even when the sprint had ended. This was minor however and the task would just be added to future sprints. Overall, the platform was very helpful in getting the team organised and added motivation from seeing the tasks being ticked off one by one. Utilizing the Agile method alongside Jira really helped the team progress, the flexibility meant that we could chip away at tasks while balancing other workloads. Coupling this with Jira meant that our sprints were incredibly effective, well documented and the team could clearly see the progress as our app came to life.

### Sprints

With the help of Jira and Microsoft Teams the sprints were made very easy. At the start of each sprint we would allocate people to different tasks depending on their direction. Noting team member tasks in the meeting minutes we could then move them over to Jira to begin the sprint.

We would then regroup the following week with the current progress. The team members could share what they’ve done whilst the others give encouragement and discuss improvements. We could also discuss the user and stake holder feedback that we would expect should a player of our game use the app at that moment in time. Our sprints got under way in the beginning of March and continued until early May. Each sprint centred around feature implementations required for that week, as well as including any tasks in the backlog from previous sprints. The goals for the week were decided and we kept to those goals until the end of the week. We reviewed our work at the end of each sprint. This meant that our approach towards the development of the product was consistent with the agile methodology, and given the fact that we had very little time to build the product we felt it was very important to incorporate the proto-personas during every sprint.

With respect to the meetings and sprints and how they worked, we met every Monday at 11am. And then on Wednesdays and Fridays. In every successive meeting we discussed the work we had done, and when items were assigned tasks as "complete". We compiled a list of Backlog and items that were complete. Overall, though, at the heart of this process was the users. During every sprint we had the users in mind, ensuring that we addressed their goals and demands. Overall, the sprints were managed very effectively. The team did an amazing job to chip away at the work week by week. This meant we weren’t scrambling at the end of the project to get everything done. It allowed us more time for further documentation and to add any extra simple features.

### Github

Throughout our project we utilised the version control system known as Github. Github was really important throughout the project. Not only did it hold copies of everything we’d ever done but it complemented our sprints allowing the team to work independently of each other. The team was really effective in its use of Github. There were frequent commits on all branches allowing for good version control habits. The team could push forward knowing that their work was always backed-up. This gave us confidence to keep moving forward knowing that any major mistakes could just result in a simple git revert.

Once team members were assigned some of the bigger tasks, they could create their own branches to work in. Team members wouldn’t then clash if issues arose. Many branches were created specifically for the individual games, MongoDB, API building and testing. We could then bring all our branches together under the dev branch and see our app take shape. Whilst effective, this methodology was not greatly organised and we did feel by the end of the project that we had too many branches. It did also impact the merging to our ‘dev’ branch and we needed good communication to avoid any clashes. This is an aspect we could look to improve moving forward in our work practices.

There were also certain GitHub features that we didn't utilise which would have helped us. For instance, milestones. Milestones serve to track groups of pull requests and issues in a repository. This would have further improved our prioritisation of tasks. Also, as discussed in [Sprints & Project Management](../Portfolio/Sprints_Project_Management.md), we may have also benefited from one team member becoming the GitHub expert who could then be relied on to teach the other team members how to use the platform, and offer expert advice on any issues we encountered. This would have helped us use the platform more effectively and overcome GitHub-related problems more quickly.

Overall, Github was incredibly useful and was easily the most important software used on the project. It gave team members a comfortable place to work in their own branches where others didn’t interfere. The version control was managed very well by the team and we never had any major issues merging across our changes. We would be happy and confident to utilise Github again.

### Teamwork, Communication & Organisation

The team itself was a great mix of abilities and interests. All team members were very engaging and positive which really helped us establish early ideas of our app. This made decisions very easy and we could clearly see a direction to head in early on. We discussed the team roles early on to get a good idea of what each of us wanted to be working on. This allowed us to assign members to work on the tutorials which aligned with their interests. These did diverge slightly throughout the life of the project but had no repercussions. Everyone was content with the aspects of the project they chose to do. This really helped the team members push beyond their expectations.

Throughout the project the team were well organised and attended meetings often. The communication was also excellent with all members being very responsive. This made the collaboration easy which reflected well on our projects progress. We effectively documented all our team meetings in detail which you can find [here](../Portfolio/Team_Meetings.md). The team was also excellent on a human level. No-one ever felt outcast and everyone was always supportive and respectful of each other. With this positivity we could easily crack on with the work with little pressure.

## Reflection of success of project

There have been many successes throughout the duration of this unit. One of the first hurdles we faced as a team was that one of our team members moved to a different team at the beginning of the project. This presented a few challenges. Firstly, there were fewer of us to complete the project which meant that each individual team member had, in theory, more work to complete. Secondly, this meant that our project had to be scaled back to account for a smaller team. As such, there were certain features we inevitably were unable to implement. The way we dealt with this was a success, since we did not dwell on the fact but simply moved forward with a positive mindset, aware of how much we could achieve if we remained focused and goal-oriented. With this in mind, we feel proud of how far we have come - of how we have worked as a team, on team member down, to produce a working prototype based on an idea which arose during the ideation phase. In retrospect, rather than holding us back, it seems that losing one team member gave us the motivation required to work hard and develop our product. In this sense it may have even given us more motivation than we would have otherwise had if our team member had not moved. Now, we reflect on our successes with regards to the product design.

### Design

After conducting background research and a state of the art survey we were well placed to design our product. In addition, the design and ideation phase offered an excellent opportunity to share ideas and hone in on a narrow range of games. We moved on to produce a paper prototype, prototype video, UI wireframe, and an updated UI wireframe. With these steps in the UI and UX design, we developed further insights about what our end-users wanted. We combined this information with our stakeholder stories to broaden our understanding of the requirements for our end-users. This helped enhance the design so that it was fun, engaging, and based on a [user-centred design (UCD)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design). From design to implementation, we prioritised the design around the user, focusing on their needs and usability requirements. We made sure to keep in a constant dialogue with our users through proto-personas during our weekly sprints, and the use of evaluation design methods. This gave us a solid understanding of how to design our application and meant that we were left with a highly usable and accessible product. Overall, we feel that we were successful in this pursuit, and managed to create a clean, engaging interface which prioritised the end-users' requirements, expectations and feedback.


### How well did our project fulfil the brief?


### Were objectives met?

To reflect on whether our project objectives were met, let's turn to the objectives we set ourselves and assess whether each of these was met. Consider the first of these:

  * ***Build and deploy a responsive SPA using the MEAN stack, as per the project brief.***

With this objective, it is fair to say that we were successful. To demonstrate this, we will cover each of the services that form part of the MEAN stack and how we used them:

* **(M) MongoDB** - MongoDB was used as persistent data storage for user account information and game record data (rankings, win/loss data etc.)
* **(E) Express** - Express was used to provide a thin layer on top of NodeJS to enable communication between the front end and back end, i.e. routing, middleware and static file serving
* **(A) Angular** - Angular was used to build the components that formed the front end of our application
* **(N) NodeJS** - NodeJS was used to implement the backend of our application in the form of our API and the multiplayer functionality of the games

Generally speaking, we consider our SPA to be responsive. The application scales well across a multitude of devices and screen sizes. We are aware however, that the responsiveness of the games could be improved. Due to the target demographic of the application being the elderly, our design philosophy has revolved around developing an application that is visually clear, simple and easy to use. Therefore, we developed the games with the intention of them being used predominantly on laptop and desktop monitor size screens. The users are able to access their accounts, view their account information such as friends, leaderboards etc. but when they try to access games, they are gently pointed towards accessing the application on a larger-screened device to utilise the full functionality of the application. Jitsi is also unavailable in its embedded form on mobile devices (this is the design of Jitsi, not our SPA), so the users would also have to download the Jitsi Meet mobile application and we didn't like the idea of our application depending on other applications. This has been further discussed in the 'Future Work' section of this conclusion.

* ***Implement a login, leaderboard and two board games with multiplayer functionality and video chat.***

With this objective, we can consider it to have been completely fulfilled. We successfully implemented all of the above functionality it was compounded to form the MVP for our application. We are aware however, that there is opportunity for further refining of these implementations. The multiplayer functionality could be further developed to employ a matchmaking and lobby system and the games lack session persistence. Although Jitsi was a more than capable solution for enabling real-time video chat for our application, it would be beneficial for us to develop a proprietary video chat API in future to allow us to tailor the functionality exactly to the needs of our application. These potential developments are discussed further in the 'Future Work' section of this conclusion.

  * ***Conduct extensive user testing through the development lifecycle, in line with the Agile framework, to ensure the product meets the needs of the end-user.***

We successfully used the Agile methodology during this project. One of the first things we did to make sure of this was to create stakeholder stories, which we then used during the sprints to generate feedback on key implementations. The use of proto-personas and questionnaires were indispensable for this purpose, as we were able to reflect on what our end-users would think about the style and function of features. We conducted Beta testing which helped verify software compatibility with different software, different network connections, and obtained users’ feedback on software usability and functionality. All of these actions and decisions were in line with Agile methodology, and were applied throughout the duration of the development. As such, we feel as though we met this objective with a clear, thoughtful, and consistent approach.

  * ***Explore the effectiveness of this platform for improving states of wellbeing in end-users through user testing and self-report questionnaires.***

We were unable to complete this objective due to the time constraints placed on us. Despite the fact we were unable to meet this objective, we believe this could be a really fruitful extension of our product since it could help gather useful data on the impact of our product on subjective feelings of wellbeing and self-reported levels of loneliness and isolation. Whilst these questions lie outside the realm of this project, they nonetheless could be addressed in a small-scale study investigating the role of our platform on these phenomena. The PENS model, discussed in [the Background section of this report](../Portfolio/Background.md), could be used to inform the questions to ask the participants of such a study, or the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQIJ) proposed by IJsselsteijn et al., 2008 which consists of  seven constructs - Competence, Sensory & Imaginative Immersion, Flow, Tension/Annoyance, Challenge, Negative affect and Positive affect - could also be used.

  * ***Deliver a SPA that is easy to use and is inclusive of older adults with lower levels of digital literacy.***

Throughout every stage of the development of our application, our design philosophy has revolved around making the application as clear and easy to read and navigate as possible, without compromising any of the functionality of our app. Correia de Barros et. al (2014) suggest that providing a reasonable amount of space between interactive items on the page helps to avoid the accidental pressing of buttons. We took this on board and the clearest example of this can be seen with both the signup and login buttons, as well as the game selection buttons. They are large, include large text and are spaced quite far apart.

They also suggest avoiding placing interactive items towards the edge of the window to avoid pressing items external to the application page itself. With certain parts of the application such as the navigation bar, it is hard to avoid this, but wherever possible, such as with the games, we put emphasis on keeping items as central as possible. One of their recommendations that could have been implemented to a greater extent was including icons with the buttons where possible, to make what a button does more obvious. This was implemented for the home button on the navigation bar, but perhaps including icons for the memory game and Connect Four would help to make the app even more easily navigable.

### How did we use 'serious play' in our application?

As discussed in the background and UX design sections of this report, the concept of 'serious play' underpinned our research, design and development of our project. Referring back to the work of Zimmerman (2004), we ultimately ended up using play as an activity mediated through structure and rules. This was demonstrated through our choice of games having a clear, fixed ruleset. Without this structure, it would have undermined our objective of the challenging the user, and allowing the user to challenge others. We developed leaderboards and a scoring system to help solidify this. On reflection, we determined that an element of unstructured play could also have been implemented to offer some respite from competitive gameplay. We therefore chose to implement the multiplayer functionality of the memory game as a team game where your score is shared. We have also discussed adding further collaborative experiences such as shared digital drawing canvasses.

Further to this, we decided to create our platform to meet the needs of our players, and to satisfy Ryan's three needs of pride, autonomy, and social belonging. We felt that these needs would be best satisfied through an interaction with rules and structure for the following reasons. In the case of pride, we agreed that a game with rules and an underlying level of competition would encourage our end-users to become more competent and with that gain self-confidence. This, in turn, would improve their sense of self-efficacy and pride. With autonomy, admittedly a game with rules and structure could be seen as putting constraints on a person's sense of agency, but we thought rules and structure would also leave the users feeling like they were in control of their own decisions and strategies. With the need of relatedness, we felt this need would be met through interaction and competition with friends and family, especially with video chat and multiplayer functionality. Using these needs we felt well equipped to use the concept of serious play to address the most important basic human requirements in the PENS theory of play.


## Impact of Covid-19

We now turn to a discussion of the impact of Covid-19. In this section we will give a subjective account of how the pandemic affected our lives and in particular how it impacted our studies in general and the software engineering project in particular.

### How Covid-19 affected our project

The outbreak of COVID-19 in March, and the subsequent lockdowns running up to the end of April affected each us in many ways. It is to this topic we now turn our attention. In particular, we will cover how the pandemic affected our project and our working practices.

The first major impact was communication. Specifically, Covid-19 prevented us from meeting in person. As a result, we were reliant on communication platforms to not only talk about the project but work collaboratively on the coding and documentation side of things. The other issue we faced during this time was the stress component of the pandemic. Not only did we feel increased levels of stress due to the existential threat of the virus, but we also found that the MSc conversion was especially challenging given we had no face-to-face interactions with tutors, TAs or fellow students in the second term. In relation to our group project, we feel that the pandemic hindered our progress during the design and idea generation part of the process. We believe that being in the same room and bouncing ideas off each other face-to-face could have helped us generate more ideas, at a faster rate. Despite this, we are in agreement that we are satisfied with our idea and that we likely would have chosen to move forward with this idea regardless of whether we synthesised it in person or virtually.

To look at this from an alternate perspective however, it could be suggested that the compulsory use of virtual communication has had a positive impact on the project. Having the group chat for our team on Microsoft Teams meant that we always had a line of communication open between us. This enabled the instantaneous sharing of ideas or requests for feedback. If we were predominantly communicating during lab time, this bouncing of ideas and feedback may have been less consistent and time may have been spent developing the application in a direction that may not have been desired by all group members.

At the outset of the project, it was suggested that we work in teams of five. We initially formed a group of five, however a member left to join another group. We struggled to find another member to fill up our group and we feel that if we had been on campus for the group assignment stage of this module, that we may have been able to find a fifth member more easily, or at least discuss re-arranging group numbers with other groups that did not have five members. Despite this, although we believe that the workload undertaken posed us more of a challenge in terms of time required to deliver the project, the group dynamic we fostered was perfect for delivering the application, and having a fifth member could ultimately have negatively impacted this.

## Social and ethical implications

Ethical issues concerning data privacy and security of our prototype were addressed by our team throughout the project. Let's consider these.

### Our ethical responsibilities

First, we will turn to our ethical responsibilities as moral individuals, using normative ethics. Using those insights we will explain the ethical framework we used to guide us throughout the project, before turning our attention to the social implications associated with our product and data protection.

### Normative ethics and ethical frameworks

To determine whether our approach was morally permissible, we can apply the theories of normative ethics. According to deontological and virtue ethics perspectives, our project should have complied with some ethical codes of conduct. This is because compliance with codes of conduct ensures conformity to universal rules, norms and core values, which is in accordance with deontological and virtue ethics since both theories require adherence to rules and values. Failing to adhere to these rules and values, therefore, amounts to unethical behaviour. In light of this, we decided to follow the [BSC code of conduct, a value-based code of ethics for IT professionals](https://www.bcs.org/membership/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/). We decided this would be appropriate to use as an ethical framework to guide our actions and decisions during the project, and which aligns with the goals of normative ethics.

By explicitly citing this as our code of conduct, we felt that we would be more likely to avoid behaving unethically, and that if we were challenged on ethical grounds despite having followed this code of conduct, we would be able to justify our actions by referring to it. This, we felt, would be particularly important in relation to working practices concerned with the way we handled and stored people's data. In addition to this, from a consequentialist perspective, conformance to the BSC arguably produces a morally good outcome, which focuses on mitigating risk and maximising human welfare.

Further to this, took the decision to follow the W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles. According to these principles, "The web should empower an equitable, informed and interconnected society". This captures the main idea at the heart of our ethical approach to creating our product.


### Social implications

#### Negative implications

Given that our product is an online game, we recognise that it could cause addiction and mental health issues in some individuals. Indeed, the World Health Organisation [WHO] (2018) recently [included “gaming disorders” in the list of mental health conditions](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder). According to the WHO, gaming disorders refer to “persistent or recurrent behaviour pattern of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.”[[**1**]](#references). This, coupled with evidence that excessive use of online games is linked to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression [[**2**]](#references), indicates that we should be aware of the potential ramifications of our platform. One particular concern might be that our leaderboard is a competitive feature that might serve to elevate stress levels. With regards to the leaderboard, the behavioural effect of playing more games on the platform could be viewed as operant conditioning, where behaviours are encouraged and discouraged with associated rewards and punishments (Staddon, 2003, p. 116), in this case winning and losing. This could cause stress, anxiety, or depression in some individuals. Another potential issue concerning our product is that it could demotivate people from doing outdoor activities, and as such decentivise healthy behaviours. Further to this, too much screen time can cause eye strain. Given these considerations, it is worth being mindful of the potential downstream consequences of the platform.

However, whilst these considerations are important to bear in mind, it is not clear whether there would be a causal link between playing games on our SPA and increased levels of negative emotions. The most we could reasonably speculate is that there may be a correlation. Notwithstanding this point, these social implications would be concerning enough to merit consideration and demand that we draw up a protocol for dealing with. For instance, having a limit on the amount of time any one player can play on the platform, encouraging users to take breaks and go outside, and making sure that cooperation between players is encouraged. Since our product is still in its early stages though, there is no need to explore these options here. But it is still worth bearing in mind and thinking of ways to address any possible issues which might arise.

#### Positive implications

Despite the potential for negative outcomes when playing online games, there are numerous positive outcomes which might be realised when playing our online game. Our platform is designed to fun, engaging and social. These factors can all improve a person's wellbeing. As we discussed in the section on [using games to tackle isolation and loneliness](../Portfolio/Background.md#can-digital-games-help-tackle-the-health-concerns-associated-with-loneliness-and-isolation) in the Background section, online games can be very beneficial for older adults. Specifically, playing online games can leave people feeling connected with others and satisfied that they have achieved something, both of which lead to an improved sense of wellbeing.

Another issue our platform serves to address is the gap in digital literacy for older adults, as we discussed in the subsection [digital literacy](../Portfolio/Background.md#digital-literacy) in the Background section of the report. Designing our application with the end-users in mind, making the UI and UX simple, straightforward, and with short, concise instructions all help to make the gaming experience as easy as possible. This is important because making a game easy makes it inclusive, and serves to bridge the digital literacy gap for the elderly. That is, it helps make the experience appropriate for our end-users and inclusive. This inclusivity is key since it then redresses the digital divide for our target users.

### Data protection

Now, turning to data protection. As moral individuals, we were aware that as computer scientists we have a professional and moral responsibility to protect personal data. Our jobs involve the protection of privacy which is a fundamental moral human right - a right that preserves autonomy and dignity [[**3**]](#references) which is of paramount importance when dealing with stakeholders. That's not to say it's an absolute right like the right to life; it's a qualified right, so there are extreme circumstances in which it can be infringed upon.

Given this, from design to implementation, privacy protection was of paramount importance to use. We used the ‘The International Data Privacy Principles' (IDPPs) as an appropriate guide to managing personal data. This complies normative ethics since in enshrines values and encourages positive outcomes. A further strength of the project concerns its approach to data protection. Specifically, the we (maybe, possibly) anonymised participants' personal data, and the software has (maybe, possibly if we have time) implementations to remove personal data if the participant so desires. This is in clear accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Despite all of this, there are certainly limitations with our product. For instance, we weren't able to focus on protect data as robustly as we would have liked. This was due to time constraints and heavy workloads. One possible extension concerns testing. In particular, the software would benefit from some more extensive testing. A possible project extension to address this limitation would be to conduct rigorous tests to determine what a hacker could manipulate, attack those vulnerabilities and then fix them [[**4**]](#references).

For example, a brute-force attack to guess a user password and a simple account suspension on the third incorrect entry of the password. A secure-sockets-layer (SSL) encryption to ensure data transferred between devices is encrypted and secure would have established greater data security. These nontrivial features would bolster the security of the app and make it a better candidate for future use in data gathering, which is important given the significance of privacy and security concerns in the uptake of mobile health technologies [[**5**]](#references). Maybe this is a little over the top though for our purposes. But regardless, we can discuss this added security as a potential feature were we to scale up this project.

We are aware that if we were to develop our product beyond this point, we would need to conduct more qualitative research, including obtaining end-user testimonials, organising interviews, observations and questionnaires. These forms of qualitative research would present a number of challenges regarding data protection and would require us to apply for ethical approval.

## Future work

There is, we feel, a lot of scope to add to and extend on the features of our product. We will now consider these, beginning with adding more games.


### Adding more games

One possible extension concerns adding more games to the platform. When we began this project we planned to have four games to choose from. However, after scoping the project we realised that this was too ambitious. Instead, we decided it would be better to deploy a fully-functioning MVP with two games. But there is certainly scope to go beyond four games, and add a number of different games and different gaming categories such as cognitively challenging games, memory games, fun games, social games, and cooperative games. Our application currently does not include any form of matchmaking and is limited to just two players within one gaming session. Obviously, the implementation of the matchmaking is too substantial to be fully implemented due to the time constraints. However, this would be a good step to take moving forward should we decide to release the game to the public at large.

The flexibility of our app allows us to easily add more games for the users to enjoy and would be a great direction to expand on. However, this extension would have to be moderated since the core idea behind our application is to connect older adults together and make sure that that the platform is easy enough to use so that their lower levels of digital literacy don't exclude them from using our product. Focus groups and user testing would be required to determine the optimum number of games.


### Multiplayer session persistence

The application at the point of becoming an MVP lacks session persistence for the games. Currently, a limited amount of game data is stored on the server. For Connect Four, the server is only used to broadcast the connections of clients, the moves between clients and when the game is won. For the memory game, it is similar, however the card deck is transferred via the server to ensure it matches.

With the application functioning like this, if a player leaves the page and rejoins, they won't be able to pick up where they left off. To develop the application further, more sophisticated code could be written to store the game state in between every turn so that players can have a smoother experience in the case of a disconnect or accidental refresh. This would likely be implemented at the same time as the more advanced matchmaking/lobby system.

### Difficulty level

Another unit of functionality our application would benefit from is difficulty level feature. It’s important for the end-users to find games that are challenging but not so difficult that they don't want to play. If you’re looking for brain games for a loved one who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, for instance, you’ll want to choose brain exercises and games that are appropriate for their cognitive level. With the memory game, we could have added a difficulty level feature which enables the player to choose the number of cards to play with, where a lower number of cards would be easy, and so on. As it currently stands, the default is 20 cards. On reflection, this is a very large number of cards, which is in fact very challenging and would likely be too difficult for our end-users. With connect four, a timer could be added to put pressure on the users to complete the game within a specified time limit, in much the same way blitz chess challenges players to think and strategise more quickly than they would otherwise do.

### Invite friends to play

We have considered adding a feature to allow our users to invite their friends to use the application. This would most likely take shape in the form of the user inputting their friend's e-mail address and an automated e-mail would be sent to them asking them if they would like to join them on the website. The e-mail would include a short paragraph consisting of information such as "Your friend (insert friend name here) has invited you to play with them on NotSoBoredGames!". In the email there would also be a large button with the text "Play Now" that would direct the user to the sign up page.


### Adding a challenge and achievement system

To further encourage users to engage with the application, we could explore adding an additional layer of competition to the application that would be more suited to when the users have already begun engaging and building up a network of friends on the platform. The first idea could be to introduce a challenge-based system. For example, you could challenge your friend to a "best-of-five" challenge on Connect Four. This could then be recorded on the user's profile page as a medal of sorts. This could also be developed into individual challenges, for example "win ten games of Connect Four in one week". This could encourage users to play more games outside of their virtual friend network and in turn meet more people and potential friends, helping to further tackle the issue of isolation.

We could then extend this to developing an achievement-based system. This wouldn't need to just be win-based and it could include achievements such as "played 50 games of Connect Four in one month" or "played five games of Connect Four in a row against the same friend". Again, this could help to provide a source of extrinsic motivation for using the application and helping our users to engage with each other more.

### Adding more detailed instructions

A further extension concerns adding more detailed instructions to the application on how to navigate the site and efficiently use the full feature-set (adding friends, seeing leaderboards etc.). With your typical application, there may not be as much emphasis on implementing instructions for this, but when thinking about the demographic that the application is targeting (the elderly), we must take into consideration the fact that the baseline of computer literacy may be lower.

Potential means of delivering these instructions include written instructions, video instructions or a more developmentally time-intensive, but more comprehensive method, the development of interactive demo instructions. For example, encouraging the individual using the application to navigate the page in real-time, further reinforcing what the instructions have taught them. This would serve further purpose in allowing the user to refresh their mind on how to use the application, which may be of particular importance in users that may suffer with memory-loss issues.

### Improving application responsiveness

As alluded to earlier in this conclusion, the application is not currently designed for the games to work on smaller devices. Other functionality such as viewing your profile and leaderboards exists on mobile devices, however when users try to access the games, they are requested to access the application on a device with a larger screen. We have discussed how we would go about improving the responsiveness and we agreed that we would initially look at developing it for larger tablets such as iPads and Kindles. We have not completely ruled out the possibility of making the games responsive on smaller smart phones, but we do feel that considering the target demographic of the application, a full mobile port may not be appropriate.

### Expansion of front-end and back-end testing

Our app could also be improved via the expansion of our front-end functional testing. Currently you can see the outline of our testing for the front-end below. Whilst this covers a good range of the components on our app we have not been able to test the individual game components thoroughly. It would be nice to expand on this for further robustness prior to release.

## Impact of our work

There are several ways our work will have an impact, the first of which concerns its application in research on loneliness and isolation in the elderly population. Although we lacked the time and resources to conduct research on this topic, one future area of work which our product could be applied to is research on loneliness and isolation in the elderly. In particular, our product could be used to garner data on the effect of digital games on older adults who self-report as lonely and isolated. Specifically, researchers could conduct a small-scale study in which users' self-reported levels of loneliness and isolation are measured over a set period of time. As Alan (1999) points out, this type of hypothesis testing is an indispensable part of research since it allows researchers to test hypotheses and determine the contribution of certain independent and dependent variables. As such, this is an area of research which our product could be applied to. Indeed, the ubiquity of computers and smartphones and the self-centric orientation of their technologies capable of connecting individuals from across the globe indicates that multiplayer games with video functionality could play an important role in future research on loneliness in older adults.

A further impact concerns the the potential to help drive the networking of older people outside of the context of digital games. Perhaps our use of video chat specifically targeted towards the older demographic could act as a springboard for other researchers or developers to explore the use of video chat, chatrooms or other forms of social networking specifically for the elderly population and help to provide those who are isolated with more opportunities to connect with others. Building upon contemporary gaming platforms, we believe that this project pushes the field forward and provides a promising point of departure for future applications for older adults.
