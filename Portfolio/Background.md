# Background and Motivation

In this section, we discuss background literature, complete a state-of-the-art survey, and outline our problem definition. We start with the background literature focusing on the topic of isolation and loneliness in our ageing society, and look at how games can be used to combat these issues. We also look at the idea of serious play, and how we can apply this concept to our product. We then go on to conduct a state of the art survey looking at the existing digital games for the elderly, before explaining the problem definition and motivation behind our product and how we intend to use serious play to address our chosen problem.

## Background literature

In this section, we provide an overview of the background literature relating to social isolation and loneliness among older people. We define key terms and identify public health concerns and current interventions. But first, let's take a big picture view of the issues we seek to address.


### Setting the context

According to a recent report by the Lancet Public Health, the Covid-19 pandemic and enforced social distancing measures have significantly affected the mental health and wellbeing of older adults [[**1**]](#references). It follows from this, the author's claim, that there has been an unprecedented rise in levels of loneliness and social isolation among this demographic [[**1**]](#references). But many factors underly the emergence of these public health issues. Covid-19 has played its part, and likely acted as an accelerant driving these health issues above the normal average. But loneliness and isolation among the elderly pre-date the pandemic [[**1**]](#references). With advances in modern medicine and a rise in the global average life expectancy, ageing societies continue to grow without sufficient investments in social care infrastructure. What's more, loss of loved ones, reduced mobility, and an increased chance of illness often prevent this group from socialising, which in turn leads to an increase in loneliness and isolation. This points to a growing public health issue affecting societies worldwide - one that is likely to continue with the growing size of the elderly population.

<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background1.png)

</div>

This is the backdrop against which our analysis should proceed. But before going any further, as a preliminary it is necessary to define key terms, specifically loneliness and isolation.

### Defining key terms

Following Valtora and Hanratty, we define loneliness as both a social and emotional phenomenon. According to this definition, social loneliness refers to a "subjective negative feeling associated with a lack of social network", and emotional loneliness refers to the "absence of a specific companion"[[**2**]](#references). Social isolation, Valtora and Hanratt claim, has multiple dimensions. They suggest that social isolation refers to a lack of social interactions with friends, family, and the community [[**2**]](#references).

Our target group is adults above the age of 70. However, we acknowledge that individuals who fall short of this boundary would also benefit from the social engagement derived from playing our game. And for our user testing we asked a wide range of users to test our prototype and provide their feedback in our user test survey (see [here](../Portfolio/UX_Design.md#evolution-of-ui-design) for a discussion about the results of that survey).

### Public health concerns

Following advancements in public health and medicine, the global average life expectancy of people aged over 60 years has greatly increased. It is projected that by 2030 there will be a 56% growth in this age cohort from 901 million to 1.4 billion[[**2**]](#references). With this growth in the elderly population, a number of public health concerns will grow worse. In particular, [chronic and degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes](http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/global_health/en/.), will pose large burdens to public health. In addition, there will be a likely rise in mental health issues as well as loneliness and isolation.

There are several public health concerns linked to loneliness and isolation. Let's begin by looking at the health issues related to these phenomena. The health issues associated with loneliness and isolation range from high blood pressure and suppressed immune function to heart disease, body aches and pains, and insomnia. The second health concern is mental health issues. These issues often arise when a person is lonely and isolated. Typically, they will experience [increased levels of negative emotions such as anxiety and depression](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/lonely-older-adults.html#:~:text=Loneliness%20was%20associated%20with%20higher,risk%20of%20emergency%20department%20visits.). This is a very serious and significant effect and is closely interconnected with health issues since the adverse effects of poor mental health often impact a person's physical health. This is because poor mental health can lead to a lack of motivation to prioritise self-care and a reduced desire to go outside. The former is linked to the above-mentioned health issues and the latter can lead to melatonin suppression which is linked to insomnia.

Overall, the impact of mental health problems is nontrivial. The increased likelihood of depression can lead to suicidal ideation, a weakened immune system due to a bad diet and lack of exercise, as well as [health problems such as heart disease and high blood pressure](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/lonely-older-adults.html). The third public health concern is cognitive decline. As with the previous two health concerns, cognitive decline is intimately tied to poor mental and physical health. Without a social network, people can experience a decline in their mental acuity, choosing to avoid activities that challenge their minds and promote cognitive development in late adulthood. Research shows that some cognitive functions such as remembering vocabulary remain during older age, while others such as conceptual reasoning and memory decline. It is very important, therefore, that older adults exercise their minds to avoid cognitive decline [[**3**]](#references).


### Can digital games help tackle the health concerns associated with loneliness and isolation?

Before reviewing existing solutions and identifying the gap in the market concerning digital games for the elderly, we will look at what science tells about the role digital games can play in tackling loneliness and isolation.

According to research by Kaufman et al, digital games offer opportunities for older adults to socialise and engage with each other. This, Kaufman claims, improves their emotional states and reduces depression, as well as having social benefits and improved cognitive performance concerning working memory and attention [[**5**]](#references). This is something they can do without much difficulty. It is also fun, entertaining and provides real value and meaning to their lives.

<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background2.png)

</div>

Although the widely held view of ageing is that physical and cognitive decline are inevitable aspects of getting older, recent neuroscience research suggests that these trends can be slowed significantly with the right training and techniques. In particular, playing online games can have significant benefits for the elderly in their daily lives.

Researchers at King's College London have shown that brain training games are very beneficial for older adults, both in terms of cognitive functions such as memory and decision making but also in terms of dealing with everyday tasks such as managing finances, administrative tasks, and shopping [[**6**]](#references). Research has also shown that brain training daily can have long-lasting effects on a person's cognitive abilities. For instance, Hall et al's (2012) review found that a large majority of studies on the effects of digital gameplay on the elderly demonstrated positive outcomes. Zhang and Kaufman's 2015 review concluded that digital gameplay had positive outcomes in balance, executive function, and processing speed. Furthermore, most research shows that playing games improve life satisfaction and quality of life. In addition to this, there is research that suggests that maintaining daily mental activity can help delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

The level of difficulty of our chosen games was something to bear in mind since research shows that playing more challenging games yields greater benefits than setting the game at a level that is too easy. For instance, Kaufman et al have shown that "playing at an intermediate and advanced level can provide greater benefits than playing at a beginner level since the cognitive demands are greater" [[**4**]](#references). Whilst this indicates that the game difficulty ideally should be challenging, it's worth bearing in mind that the game also has to be enjoyable and fun. So, with that in mind, we would need to carefully decide on a baseline difficulty that would have benefits without the drawbacks associated with a game that is too difficult to even enjoy. With this in mind, we should encourage our older loved ones to get online. Get them playing games they enjoy — scrabble, chess, sudoku - and show them how fun it can playing online games. The science tells us that not only is it social but it promotes healthy behaviours and keeps your brain active and focused.

Now, let's look at serious play and the motivations behind playing games.


### What is 'serious play' and how can it be used to address loneliness and isolation?

Following Zimmerman (2004), we assign 'play' three categories. The first category refers to 'play' as 'game play', where play is a verb, involving action. In these cases play arises through the interaction with structures and rules. This is what one might typically think of when talking about play. The second category is ludic activity. This refers to instances of play where activities are not only games, but rather unstructured play. It's a simulation of play, and there are no strongly defined objectives. The third category involves play as a mindset. Here, play is more of an adjective where the spirit of play is imbibed into non-typical play activities.

There is a theory of play, developed by Richard Ryan, using the 'Player Experience of Needs Satisfaction' (PENS) model. According to this model, we have three key needs to satisfy through play. Firstly, there is competence and feelings of pride and self-confidence, self-efficacy and mastery of a challenge. By instilling these feelings of pride and self-efficacy in the end-user, you help to push a person reach what they think to be there limits and then go beyond those limits. Secondly, there is autonomy. This need is all about freedom and agency; feeling in control and being able to self-express. Thirdly and finally, there is relatedness, of connecting with others and feeling like you are a part of a community. These are aspects of intrinsic motivations. It is these three needs that we aim to satisfy through play.

From our perspective, we decided it was important to address the issues of loneliness and isolation in a fun, structured, and playful way. This can be categorised within the first of Zimmerman's categories, namely 'game play'. We also decided to create our platform to meet the needs of our players, and in particular to satisfy Ryan's three needs of pride, autonomy, and social belonging. We felt that these needs would be best satisfied through an interaction with rules and structure for the following reasons. In the case of pride, we agreed that a game with rules and an underlying level of competition would encourage our end-users to become more competent and with that gain self-confidence. This, in turn, would improve their sense of self-efficacy and pride. With autonomy, admittedly a game with rules and structure could be seen as putting constraints on a person's sense of agency, but we thought rules and structure would also leave the users feeling like they were in control of their own decisions and strategies. With the need of relatedness, we felt this need would be met through interaction and competition with friends and family, especially with video chat and multiplayer functionality. But what about our approach to rules? When it came to our approach to game rules we had to ask ourselves a series of questions. It is to these questions we now turn.


### Rules versus open-endedness

When it came to rules, we felt that it was important to have several important questions to ask ourselves to inform the process of altering our design while keeping play at the centre of our features:

    * Does your system have rules?
    * How does the user learn or discover the rules?
    * How does the user's interaction with the rules make it playful?
    * Does the user get to define the rules? And is it possible to break the rules?
    * How do the rules help the user achieve the objectives?
    * How do the rules relate to the serious problem that our project addresses?

Rules were, we decided, an important part of our gameplay experience. Opting for an open-ended approach would have undermined one of the main aspects of our platform, namely to compete against others and challenge yourself. As such, without rules, it would have been difficult to engender competition between players. Along with reducing loneliness, using competition to challenge players cognitively was one of the main aims of our application. The cognitive benefits of playing games are well-understood, as we discuss later in this section.

Now, let's turn to the questions above, and provide our answers to those questions. It was clear that our application should have rules, and that those rules should be straightforward and explained at the beginning of any gameplay. The user's interaction with the rules can be made playful by introducing a point system and leaderboard, and this information could be displayed in a playful way. The user won't be able to define the rules, since that would complicate matters and perhaps confuse the end-users. And breaking the rules will be prohibited since to do so would undermine the spirit of the interaction and the underlying competition to win points and reach the top of the leaderboard.

<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background-rules.jpg)

</div>

The rules help the users to achieve the objectives by forcing the users to challenge themselves and beat their opponents. This creates a fun interaction. The rules also relate to the serious problem of loneliness and isolation by engaging the users to compete and interact in a way that is fun and playful and, ultimately, serves to mitigate the negative effects of loneliness and isolation.

### The psychology behind playing games

To better understand how our end-users will use our platform, we now consider the psychological factors underlying the human desire to play games. To service the needs of our users, there are a number of important questions to ask ourselves. These questions include:

 * Does our app have a clear goal?
 * Is this goal apparent up front to the user? or uncovered through use? or never discovered?
 * Does our app raise awareness of a particular issue?
 * Does our app facilitate learning?

Provoking behaviour change, facilitating learning, and promoting wellbeing through socialising are all potential avenues our app could go down. But it is crucial that we have a clear idea of what our application is designed for. For our purposes, the goal is to satisfy the PENS model, by creating a platform where older adults can develop competence, exercise autonomy and feel connected with others. These psychological factors are crucial for success.

Delving even deeper into human psychology, there are a number of motivations with respect to playing games which we ought to bear in mind when answering the above questions. The two main motivations which we shall consider here are extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. Let's go over these.

### Extrinsic vs intrinsic motivations

In the context of playing a game, a person is said to have have extrinsic motivations in the form of leaderboards, winning and social contact - external factors which a person interacts with. Intrinsic motivations, by contrast, come from within. That is, intrinsic motivation includes enjoyment, purpose, growth and curiosity. These psychological phenomena arise in the mind and body and have emotional, psychological and cognitive dimensions. How do these two motivations interact and exercise influence over the other?

To see this in action, let's consider gamification. Gamification commonly occurs when extrinsic motivators are applied without providing support for the development of intrinsic motivators. It also occurs when the extrinsic motivators are not valuable enough. Scores and leaderboards, for instance, are extrinsic motivators which visualise game display progress over time. But if these visualisations represent growth and development for a person, and gives them a sense of purpose and true enjoyment then we find that the extrinsic motivation transforms into intrinsic motivation.

<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background-motivations.jpg)

</div>

So, does there need to be a score for our purposes? Scores support extrinsic factors which can be highly motivating, however they can also be negative for those who aren't doing particularly well. To address this, we decided to include a collaborative aspect to the memory game where players cooperate to complete the game and acquire points to compete against others. This was something we decided to include in the memory game because cooperation can give rise to a strong sense of purpose and enjoyment without the negative consequences of solely competing against another player. A further extension combining cooperation with competition could cultivate a good balance between both styles of game, and ensure that serious play is present in our product with a slight twist.

But none of these considerations are relevant if the application is too difficult to use. We need to be mindful of the usability of our product, and in particular the usability requirements for our end-users. This leads us to the concept of digital literacy.

### Digital literacy

Digital literacy is an important consideration when creating an online application for the elderly, particularly when dealing with the UI and UX design. The reasons for this are simple. Learning to use technologies can help older adults become more included in modern digital society. If they aren't included, they are, by definition, excluded. But learning these technologies can be very hard, especially for older adults. So, it is important to make efforts to ensure that these digital technologies are inclusive, where inclusive means easy to access and understand.

But what exactly is digital literacy? According to Gilster (1997)[[**8**]](#references) digital literacy is the ability to use and understand information from various digital devices. This definition may, of course, be contested. But for our purposes it clearly defines the term, and it serves to inform our design choices with respect to the UI and UX of our platform. Our aim, therefore, is to make using our digital platform simple and accessible so that older adults can learn and improve their level of digital literacy.

<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background-literacy.jpg)

</div>

Increasing levels of digital literacy among older adults has many obstacles, however. These obstacles extend beyond systematic issues concerning insufficient policies and programs for the elderly. As mentioned in the previous subsection on [digital games tackling loneliness and isolation](#can-digital-games-help-tackle-the-health-concerns-associated-with-loneliness-and-isolation), older adults tend to have lower memory and self-efficacy. They also require more time to learn new things and understand new materials[[**9**]](#references). What's more, they are much less experienced with these technologies, having spent a large portion of their lives without these technologies. These challenges - systemic, cognitive, and experience-based - make learning new technologies very difficult for the elderly population, and therefore leads to low up-take of new technologies and devices. Hence, there is a low level of digital literacy among this group.

In light of these considerations, our approach to the UI and UX will based on a [user-centred design (UCD)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design). For a discussion of our approach to UX design, see the section on [UX Design](../Portfolio/UX_Design.md).


## State of the art survey: what is out there already?

We now turn to our state-of-the-art survey. After reviewing the state-of-the-art technologies currently in use, we discovered that digital games have proven to be a very useful tool for helping the older population with social, emotional, and cognitive benefits.

<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background11.png)

</div>

We now turn to the state-of-the-art survey. There exist a wide range of digital games designed for the elderly. There also exist games that weren't necessarily designed for the elderly, but can nonetheless be easily used by them. Mobile phone games are a good option as there are thousands of fun, free games that allow you to play against friends, family, and a vast number of other people in the world.

There are also console games, but for our purposes we will be focusing on games that you can access through a webpage or on your smartphone. Some of the most popular games include Bejeweled, which involves swapping bright gems of different shapes and colours to earn points. Gummy Drop! which is a game that enables you to rebuild monuments from around the world. AARP's free online games host a huge range of card, puzzle, and arcade games. Let's focus on three of these: AARP, Gametable's free online games, and Lexulous. After we have looked at these games, we will look at three outliers that also merit consideration.

### AARP's free online games
___

<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background5.png)

</div>

This site contains a very large number of different board games ranging from sudoku and checkers to chess and scrabble. It has a membership fee of $12 per year. It is fairly straightforward to navigate, however the webpage is noticeably cluttered and there exists no video communication functionality.


### The Pros:

- Site contains a wide variety of games
- Responsive
- Clean designed

### The Cons:

- Membership fee is quite high
- Paradox of choice - too many games to choose from
- No video game functionality

Overall, the design and layout of this platform is not appropriate for our target demographic, namely the over 70s. Let's now look at another online platform.

### Gametable's free online Games
___

<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background4.png)

</div>

This site contains a fewer games that AARP. It's free. It is a clean, straightforward homepage and is very easy to use. No video communication functionality.


### The Pros:
- Straightforward to navigate
- It's free
- Fewer games
- Clean design
- Engaging interface


### The Cons:
- No video communication functionality
- Fewer games
- No multiplayer functionality


### Lexulous
___

<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background3.png)

</div>

For example, Lexulous and Words with friends are scrabble-style games easily downloaded from the App store.


### The Pros:
- Straightforward to use
- Multiplayer functionality
- Possible to play with friends and family
- Good for brain training


### The Cons:
- Limited to scrabble-style game
- Is it better than competitors, for e.g., wordswithfriends?
- Requires download which might confuse users

Having considered these main applications we now turn our attention to some outliers.

___

## Outliers

There are a few outliers which host digital games which can be used by the elderly. The following are three such outliers which are worth considering with regard to loneliness and isolation in older adults.


### CogniFit Brain Fitness

[CogniFit Brain Fitness](https://www.cognifit.com/)

CogniFit is a healthcare company with their very own app designed to strengthen cognitive health. Their app is accompanied by web games, all backed by science. They perform a battery of tests to see where your baseline is and provide you with games and tasks to strengthen your skills.

### Key Features:

- Assesses over 20 cognitive skills
- Developed by neuroscience experts
- Available on iOS and Android
- Price: Free with in-app purchases; premium subscriptions $19.99/month or $119.99/year

This application differs from the above-mentioned platforms because it emphasises using science-based information to provide games for its users.


### Personal Zen

[Personal Zen](https://personalzen.com/)

This app is a bit different from the rest. It’s a brain game that’s focused on improving your mental health by reducing your anxiety and stress. The game uses principles based on 20 years of clinical and neuroscience research and has been found to be effective in clinical studies. Regular use is said to help improve your mental health in the long term, although a single session can help you reduce stress and feelings of anxiety. This addresses the very important issue of mental health problems in our target population.

### Key Features:

- Relieves anxiety and stress
- A simple game to play
- Apps available for iOS and Android
- Price: Free


### Happify

[Happify](https://www.happify.com/)


The final outlier is an application designed to change one's mindset. Using principles from positive psychology and mindfulness, Happify is another kind of app that can actually improve your mental health and make you happier. The process is slow and steady, but it promises to change one's mindset. It’s free to start, so you can give it a try and see if it’s for you before subscribing.

### Key Features:

- Exercises to improve emotional health
- Techniques have proven to work by scientists
- Engaging activities and games can be used anywhere
- Price: Free to start; subscription plans start at $11.67/month

Having now identified three outliers in the market, we now ask ourselves the question: is there a gap in the market? Which is to say, is there an area or service which current products aren't serving which we can exploit? Let's take a look.

### A gap in the market

After conducting our state-of-the-art survey, we realised that the trend among existing gaming platforms for the elderly is for applications with a large number of different games to choose from. There was also a trend among some outliers to apply the principles of positive psychology to change the mindset of the user - that is, using the techniques of mindfulness to alter the end-users' perception of the world around them. This was an interesting angle to come from. Although we decided to not adopt this approach it certainly got us thinking about how basic psychological principles can be applied to shape a person's understanding about themselves. We were particularly interested in how with the right tools a person can shift their perception to focus on the positive features of lived experience. And view that experience as multifaceted, embodying feelings, sensations, thoughts, perceptions, and behaviours — each with its own experiential quality, enmeshed in an intricate web of causation. Despite this, we decided to turn focus on creating an online gaming platform. But how did we intend to build on and improve existing platforms?

One thing was very clear after conducting our state of the art survey: we noticed that a large majority of these platforms were overly complicated, difficult to navigate, and lacked video chat functionality. Having researched and gathered information about games for older adults, we were left with the insight that there currently exists a gap in the market. In particular, there is a gap for a site similar to Gametable, mentioned above, which like Gametable is easy to use, offers a small number of games to choose from, but which has the additional features of multiplayer and video communication functionality. These added features, we concluded, *were essential* to address the issues of loneliness and isolation. The reason is simple. Playing an online game by yourself is very different to playing with a friend or family member. Not only did we realise this, but we recognised that these features of multiplayer and video chat were really important for connecting older adults. Being able to see your opponent, either a friend or family member, is a very easy way to make you feel like you've socialised with those individuals. This then satisfies the third need of [Ryan's PENS model](#what-is-serious-play-and-how-can-it-be-used-to-address-loneliness-and-isolation), namely, the need for relatedness and social belonging. It was these features, therefore, which we believed were crucial for addressing the problems of loneliness and social isolation.


<div align="center">

![alt text](../Logo/background6.png)

</div>


## Problem definition

When considering the problem definition, we felt it was important to combat an issue that was both relevant and of real importance. As such, we decided social isolation and loneliness in the elderly would be a good target problem since these are pressing issues in modern times for which there are few available online tools designed to address these issues.

Our problem definition was:

**Ideal**
```
  → Digital games can be leveraged to address the societal issues of loneliness and isolation in the elderly
    population by connecting them with friends and loved ones through a fun, engaging platform.
```
**Reality**
```
  → Currently, existing gaming platforms for the elderly lack ease of use and video chat functionality.
```
**Consequences**
```
  → There is an insufficient number of digital games for the elderly, which presents an untapped resource
    for tackling loneliness and isolation.
```
**Proposal**
```
  → To address this gap in the market, we propose NotSoBored Games, a simple online board game experience,
    with a user-oriented design and fun video chat functionality to reconnect friends and loved ones suffering
    from the effects of loneliness and isolation.
```

Social isolation and loneliness in the elderly and insufficient online tools to help address these issues. Our proposed solution to this problem was to connect the elderly through an online multiplayer game designed to reduce feelings of loneliness and improve health and wellbeing.

Clearly, the problem of social isolation and loneliness in the elderly is a huge issue facing humanity. A growing elderly population with increased needs in later life present a serious health care crisis. The scope and challenge of this problem, clearly, go beyond the scope of our project. In light of this, our scope is narrowed to make a real, meaningful impact on the lives of our target population.

## Motivation

The aim of our webpage is to create a SPA capable of combating the real-world problem of loneliness and isolation. The motivation behind this aim is simple. We can see that we live in an ageing society with inadequate social care infrastructure, and we know from personal experience with elderly relatives that they are particularly vulnerable to loneliness and isolation. There is an abundance of digital games out there, but a noticeable shortage of games designed for the elderly. Our motivation is to address this gap in the market, and try to leverage a digital game platform to mitigate loneliness and isolation in this demographic. This is important because as average life expectancies rise and ageing societies continue to grow the social care infrastructure currently in place is unlikely to effectively address these issues.

Why is this important though? It's important because improving the wellbeing of older adults is a moral issue that ought to be addressed to prevent or lessen human suffering. So, doing anything to mitigate loneliness and isolation among these individuals is, therefore, of ethical importance. What's more, we believe these issues can, to some extent, be addressed through the medium of digital games. Whilst we acknowledge the limits of our project, we still recognise that improving one person's wellbeing is a worthy cause. And if it's possible to have a positive impact on more that one person's life then that's even better. Drawing on our own personal experiences with elderly grandparents and relatives, we new how important With this in mind, we intended to create a product that can help improve the day-to-day wellbeing of this demographic.
