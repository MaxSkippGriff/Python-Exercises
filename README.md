## Our Webpage

NotSoBored games is a single page app (SPA) designed to tackle social isolation and loneliness in the elderly population through an engaging, multiplayer board game experience. With different board games to choose from, you'll be spoilt for choice as you play with friends and family to earn points and compete for the top spot on the leaderboard. So, if you're tired of lockdown and want to connect with loved ones then this online multiplayer experience is just for you.

Reconnect, play fun games, and enjoy yourself. With live video chat, you'll be able to see each other as you go head-to-head, competing at different levels of difficulty for a real challenge. But remember: **this isn't just play, this is** ***'serious play'***.

## Abstract

According to recent figures, around 50% of people over the age of 60 will face social isolation and around 33% will experience some level of loneliness during the remaining period of their lives [[**1**]](#references). These figures point to a growing public health issue affecting older members of the population — one that is likely to continue within ageing societies across the globe. We seek to address these public health issues through an online gaming platform. In particular, we propose NotSoBored games, a SPA which prioritises fun gameplay and ease of use to ensure that it is accessible for older adults with lower levels of digital literacy. Built using the [MEAN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mean-stack), our platform consists of a start page, login, two different multiplayer games with video feed, a scoring system, leaderboard, and profile page. We conduct extensive user testing through the development lifecycle to ensure the product meets the needs of the end-user, and apply 'serious play' throughout the application. As a consequence, our product serves to reconnect older adults in a fun, engaging way, with a [user-centred design (UCD)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design) and a clear aim to reduce levels of loneliness and isolation in older adults.


## Aims and Objectives

The overarching aim of this project is to use an online board game experience to reduce loneliness and social isolation among older people. To realise this aim, we create a playful, easy-to-use online multiplayer gaming platform delivered through a SPA.

Given the huge societal impact of the COVID-19 crisis with restrictions on people's lives and enforced "social distancing" measures, there has been a significant rise in levels of loneliness and social isolation in the general population, particularly among older adults [[**2**]](#references).  NotSoBored games is designed to help combat these public health concerns. Our proposed method differs from and contributes to existing methods by combing a simple, visually appealing user interface with video communication functionality. This delivers an engaging experience, unlike existing online games which lack video communication functionality and ease of use.

Our project objectives are as follows:

  * Build and deploy a responsive SPA using the [MEAN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mean-stack), as per the project brief.
  * Design and implement a login, leaderboard, and two board games with multiplayer functionality and video chat.
  * Conduct extensive user testing through the development lifecycle to ensure the product meets the needs of the end-user, and applies playfulness - and 'serious play' - throughout the application.
  * Explore the effectiveness of this platform for improving states of wellbeing in end-users through user testing and self-report questionnaires.
  * Deliver a SPA that is easy to use and is inclusive of older adults with lower levels of digital literacy.

We investigate whether these objectives are met and, based on our results, claim that our application successfully uses 'serious play' to help tackle the growing issue of loneliness and isolation in this group.

In our project report, we explain and analyse our SPA from ideation to implementation. In particular, we give an overview of background literature, conduct a state-of-the-art survey, provide a detailed account of our system design, implementation, and project management before evaluating our progress and identifying promising avenues for future work.
